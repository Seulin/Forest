# Forest
This repository divided two parts. Web page 'Forest' and 'Code plagiarism detector algorithms.' <br>
'Code plagiarism detector algorithms' are included in folder 'StyleFunc.'

## Introduction
The website Forest was created to provide a convenient educational environment through WEB IDE. Therefore, each user can manage classes and scores, and codes can be written and executed on the IDE screen.

- The Ubuntu server was provided through the EC2 service of AWS.
- Docker python container was used for independent code execution by students. This enables the website to offer limited resources and enhance server security by creating a separate environment for each user.
- Nodejs and Expressjs were used to develop the backend of the webiste.
- Vuejs was used as the frontend framework to efficiently divide the screen into components and manage them since code execution and scoring are performed in real-time.
